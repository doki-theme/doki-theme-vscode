# Configuration

## Background Images

**Background Wallpaper** is probably one of the best features of the plugin.
This feature will set the background image to the current theme's official wallpaper.

**Important!!** Installing theme assets requires me to corrupt VS-Code by modifying CSS. You will have to use the "Remove Sticker/Background" command to restore VS Code back to supported status before unistalling. 
[This plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lehni.vscode-fix-checksums) can remove the annoying `Unsupported` warning.

**Glass Pane effect**

## Stickers

**Show sticker** allows you to control the presence of the cute sticker in the bottom right-hand corner of your IDE.

## Suggestive Content

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://doki.assets.unthrottled.io/misc/suggestive/cultured.gif" ></img>
</div>

So I thought it was a good idea to add a bit of culture to this plugin.
<sup><sup>Ya boi is horny on main.</sup></sup>

I will give you a bit of a warning before you install suggestive content.
Some of us are professional Otaku, who want to remain, well...professional.
Don't worry if you choose to continue, I won't ask you again for that specific theme.

Applies for the following content:

- Rias Onyx: Secondary Content


## Remove Assets

Removes both the sticker and wallpaper from your vscode and restores the supported status.

## Show Changelog

Did you know I keep a changelog?
[You can find it here!](CHANGELOG.md)

I've also supplied a `Show Changelog` action that will bring up the changes in your VSCode!
